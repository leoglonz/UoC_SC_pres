   abstract = {We analyse subhaloes in the ViaLacteaII (VL2) cosmological simulation to look for correlations among their infall times and z = 0 dynamical properties. We find that the present-day orbital energy is tightly correlated with the time at which subhaloes last entered within the virial radius. This energy-infall correlation provides a means to infer infall times for Milky Way satellite galaxies. Assuming that the Milky Way's assembly can be modelled by VL2, we show that the infall times of some satellites are well constrained given only their Galactocentric positions and line-of-sight velocities. The constraints sharpen for satellites with proper motion measurements. We find that Carina, UrsaMinor and Sculptor were all accreted early, more than 8Gyr ago. Five other dwarfs, including Sextans and Segue1, are also probable early accreters, though with larger uncertainties. On the other extreme, LeoT is just falling into the Milky Way for the first time while LeoI fell in ∼2Gyr ago and is now climbing out of the Milky Way's potential after its first perigalacticon. The energies of several other dwarfs, including Fornax and Hercules, point to intermediate infall times, 2-8Gyr ago. We compare our infall time estimates to published star formation histories and find hints of a dichotomy between ultrafaint and classical dwarfs. The classical dwarfs appear to have quenched star formation after infall but the ultrafaint dwarfs tend to be quenched long before infall, at least for the cases in which our uncertainties allow us to discern differences. Our analysis suggests that the Large Magellanic Cloud crossed inside the Milky Way virial radius recently, within the last ∼4 billion years. © 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society © 2012 RAS.},

Large-scale spectroscopic surveys of the Milky Way, both of the present (e.g., the H3 Survey; Conroy et al. (2019), APOGEE; Majewski et al. (2017), etc.) and near-future (e.g., the Milky Way Mapper, 4MOST, etc.), in combination with extensive astrometry from Gaia (Prusti et al. 2016; Brown et al. 2018) are providing observational astronomers with an impressive array of stellar positions, kinematics, chemical abundances, and ages for MW halo stars. This array of data continues to shed light on the formation history of the MW, revealing that the stellar halo is almost entirely comprised of substructure (Naidu et al. 2020) and the discovery of numerous stellar streams (see recent review; Helmi 2020), for example. With such rapid discoveries of substructure in the stellar halo, simulations of MW-like galaxies and their satellites continue to be key in relating underlying substruc-ture in the halo and the greater history of the MW (e.g., Santistevan et al. 2021; Sestito et al. 2020; Bahé et al. 2019; Wetzel et al. 2013). Obtaining spectroscopy of particularly low-density, extended stellar populations is still difficult, thus investigating the stellar halos of MW satellites is largely uncharted territory. In recent work, Johnson et al. (2020) argues for a halo-component of the well-known Sagittar-ius dwarf galaxy, featuring distinctly metal-poor stars at a higher velocity dispersion and extended radii. Similarly , Chiti et al. (2021) announced the first observations of an extended halo around the ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy Tucana II. This extended population of},

   abstract = {Observations of the low-mass satellites in the Local Group have shown high fractions of gas-poor, quiescent galaxies relative to isolated dwarfs, implying that the host halo environment plays an important role in the quenching of dwarf galaxies. Theoretical work has shown that satellite gas can be removed by a combination of ram pressure and tidal stripping from the host, though these conclusions have been complicated in recent years. In this work, we use the DC Justice League suite of high-resolution, cosmological zoom-in simulations to examine the processes of gas-loss in dwarf satellite galaxies. We track individual gas particles as they move between the satellite and host, quantify the rates of gas flow between different states, and relate these rates to the ram pressure experienced by the satellite. In computing the ram pressure, we consider the inhomogeneity of the CGM and normalize by the satellite's gravitational restoring pressure per unit area. We find that quenching is driven, to first order, by the overlapping trends of increasing gas outflow (expulsion) with increasing ram pressure ratio (P ram /P rest) and decreasing gas inflow (accretion) with decreasing host distance. We find that tidal stripping plays a minimal role in direct gas removal, relative to ram pressure, but in rare cases can assist RPS by "puffing out" the rotation curve and thus decreasing P rest. To higher order, variations in individual satellite histories are driven by unique orbital trajectories, ongoing gas consumption due to star-formation, and galaxy pre-processing.},

We show that these simulations accurately reproduce the satellite luminosity functions of observed nearby galaxies, as well as the variation in satellite quenched fractions from $M_* \sim 10^5$ solar masses to $10^\{10\}$ solar masses. We then trace the histories of satellite galaxies back to $z \sim 15$, and find that many satellites with $M_* \sim 10^\{6-8\}$ solar masses quench within 2 Gyr of infall into the host halo, while others in the same mass range remain star-forming for as long as 5 Gyr. We show that this scatter can be explained by the satellite's gas mass and the ram pressure it feels at infall. Finally, we identify a characteristic stellar mass scale of $10^8$ solar masses above which infalling satellites are largely resistant to rapid environmental quenching.},

   abstract = {The Local Group hosts a number of dwarf galaxies that show evidence of periods of little to no star formation. We use a suite of cosmological simulations to study how star formation is reignited in such galaxies. We focus on isolated galaxies at z = 0 with halo masses between 9.2×10 8 M and 8.4×10 9 M , where star formation is typically shut off by reionization or by supernova feedback. Nearly 20% of these simulated galaxies later restart star formation, due to interactions with streams of gas in the intergalactic medium, indicating that this mechanism is relatively common in this mass range and that many isolated dwarfs at z = 0 may not have been isolated throughout their histories. While high ram pressure interactions lead to stripping, the encounters that reignite star formation are low density and/or low velocity and thus low ram pressure, resulting in compression of the hot gas in the halos of our dwarfs. The gas mass bound up in hot halos can be substantial-at least an order of magnitude greater than the mass contained in HI. Consequently, we find that dwarfs that have experienced reignition tend to be more HI-rich and have a higher M H I /M * ratio at z = 0 than galaxies with continuous star formation. Using this fact, we identify galaxies in the Local Volume that might have "gappy" star formation histories, and can be studied by the Hubble Space Telescope or the James Webb Space Telescope.},

This volume-limited sample contains 12 dwarf spheroidal (dSph)/dwarf elliptical (dE), 5 dwarf spiral, 28 dwarf irregular (dI), 12 dSph/dI (transition), and 3 tidal dwarf galaxies. The sample spans a range of ∼10mag in MB and covers a wide range of environments, from highly interacting to truly isolated. From the best-fit SFHs, we find three significant results for dwarf galaxies in the ANGST volume: (1) the majority of dwarf galaxies formed the bulk of their mass prior to z ∼1, regardless of current morphological type; (2) the mean SFHs of dIs, transition dwarf galaxies (dTrans), and dSphs are similar over most of cosmic time, and only begin to diverge a fewGyr ago, with the clearest differences between the three appearing during the most recent 1Gyr; and (3) the SFHs are complex and the mean values are inconsistent with simple SFH models, e.g., single bursts, constant star formation rates (SFRs), or smooth, exponentially declining SFRs. The mean SFHs show clear divergence from the cosmic SFH at z ≲ 0.7, which could be evidence that low-mass systems have experienced delayed star formation relative to more massive galaxies. The sample shows a strong density-morphology relationship, such that the dSphs in the sample are less isolated than the dIs. We find that the transition from a gas-rich to gas-poor galaxy cannot be solely due to internal mechanisms such as stellar feedback, and instead is likely the result of external mechanisms, e.g., ram pressure and tidal stripping and tidal forces. In terms of their environments, SFHs, and gas fractions, the majority of the dTrans appear to be low-mass dIs that simply lack Hα emission, similar to Local Group (LG) dTrans DDO 210. However, a handful of dTrans have remarkably low gas fractions, suggesting that they have nearly exhausted their gas supply, analogous to LG dTrans such as Phoenix. Finally, we have also included extensive exploration of uncertainties in the SFH recovery method, including the optimization of time resolution, the effects of photometric depth, and impact of systematic uncertainties due to the limitations in current stellar evolution models. © 2011.

   abstract = {We use a sample of z ∼ 3 Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) to examine close pair clustering statistics in comparison to Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM)-based models of structure formation. Samples are selected by matching the LBG number density, n g, and by matching the observed LBG 3D correlation function of LBGs over the two-halo term region. We show that ultraviolet (UV) luminosity abundance matching cannot reproduce the observed data, but if subhaloes are chosen to reproduce the observed clustering of LBGs we are able to reproduce the observed LBG pair fraction (N c) defined as the average number of companions per galaxy. This model suggests an overabundance of LBGs by a factor of ∼5 over those observed, suggesting that only one in five haloes above a fixed mass hosts a galaxy with LBG-like UV luminosity detectable via LBG selection techniques. This overdensity is in agreement with the results of a Millennium 2 analysis and with the discrepancies noted by previous authors using different types of simulations. We find a total observable close pair fraction of 23 ± 0.6percent (17.7 ± 0.5percent) using a prototypical cylinder radius in our overdense fiducial model and 8.3 ± 0.5per cent (5.6 ± 0.2percent) in an abundance matched model (impurity corrected). For the matched spectroscopic slit analysis, we find N cs (R)=4.3±1.55(1.0±0.2) and 5.1 ± 0.2 (1.68 ± 0.02)percent, the average number of companions observed serendipitously in randomly aligned spectroscopic slits, for fiducial slits (abundance matched), whereas the observed fraction of serendipitous spectroscopic close pairs is 4.7 ± 1.5per cent using the full LBG sample and 7.1 ± 2.3per cent for a subsample with higher signal-to-noise ratio. We conduct the same analysis on a sample of dark matter haloes from the Millennium 2 simulation and find similar results. From the results and an analysis of the observed LBG 2D correlation functions, we show that the standard method of halo assignment fails to reproduce the break, or up turn, in the LBG close pair behaviour at small scale (≲20h -1kpc physical). To reconcile these discrepancies we suggest that a plausible fraction of LBGs in close pairs with lower mass (higher density) than our sample experience interaction-induced enhanced star formation that boosts their luminosity sufficiently to be detected in observational sample but are not included in the abundance matched simulation sample. © 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society © 2012 RAS.},

   abstract = {The evolution of dwarf satellites of the Milky Way is affected by the combination of ram pressure and tidal stripping, and internal feedback from massive stars. We investigate gas loss processes in the smallest satellites of the Milky Way using three-dimensional, high resolution, idealized wind tunnel simulations, accounting for gas loss through both ram pressure stripping and expulsion by supernova feedback. Using initial conditions appropriate for a dwarf galaxy like Leo T, we investigate whether or not environmental gas stripping and internal feedback can quench these low mass galaxies on the expected timescales, shorter than 2 Gyr. We find that supernova feedback contributes negligibly to the stripping rate for these low star formation rate galaxies. However, we also find that ram pressure stripping is less efficient than expected in the stripping scenarios we consider. Our work suggests that, although ram pressure stripping can eventually completely strip these galaxies, other physics is likely at play to reconcile our computed stripping times with the rapid quenching timescales deduced from observations of low mass Milky Way dwarf galaxies. We discuss the roles additional physics may play in this scenario, including host-satellite tidal interactions, cored vs. cuspy dark matter profiles, reionization, and satellite pre-processing. We conclude that a proper accounting of these physics together is necessary to understand the quenching of low mass Milky Way satellites.},

   abstract = {We perform high-resolution N-body+SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) simulations of gas-rich dwarf galaxy satellites orbiting within a Milky Way-sized halo and study for the first time the combined effects of tides and ram pressure. The structure of the galaxy models and the orbital configurations are chosen in accordance with those expected in a Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) universe. While tidal stirring of disky dwarfs produces objects whose stellar structure and kinematics resembles that of dwarf spheroidals after a few orbits, ram pressure stripping is needed to entirely remove their gas component. Gravitational tides can aid ram pressure stripping by diminishing the overall potential of the dwarf, but tides also induce bar formation which funnels gas inwards making subsequent stripping more difficult. This inflow is particularly effective when the gas can cool radiatively. Assuming a low density of the hot Galactic corona consistent with observational constraints, dwarfs with can be completely stripped of their gas content on orbits with pericenters of 50 kpc or less. Instead, dwarfs with more massive dark haloes and lose most or all of their gas content only if a heating source keeps the gas extended, partially counteracting the bar-driven inflow. We show that the ionizing radiation from the cosmic ultraviolet (UV) background at can provide the required heating. In these objects, most of the gas is removed or becomes ionized at the first pericenter passage, explaining the early truncation of the star formation observed in Draco and Ursa Minor. Galaxies on orbits with larger pericenters andor falling into the Milky Way halo at lower redshift can retain significant amounts of the centrally concentrated gas. These dwarfs would continue to form stars over a longer period of time, especially close to pericenter passages, as observed in Fornax and other dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) of the Local Group. The stripped gas breaks up into individual clouds pressure confined by the outer gaseous medium that have masses, sizes and densities comparable to the H i clouds recently discovered around M31. © 2006 RAS.},

   abstract = {The baryon cycle of galaxies is a dynamic process involving the intake, consumption and ejection of vast quantities of gas. In contrast, the conventional picture of satellite galaxies has them methodically turning a large gas reservoir into stars until this reservoir is forcibly removed due to external ram pressure. This picture needs revision. Our modern understanding of the baryon cycle suggests that in some regimes the simple interruption of the fresh gas supply may quench satellite galaxies long before stripping events occur, a process we call overconsumption.We compile measurements from the literature of observed satellite quenching times at a range of redshifts to determine if satellites are principally quenched through orbit-based gas stripping events - either direct stripping of the disc (ram pressure stripping) or the extended gas halo (strangulation) - or from internally driven star formation outflows via overconsumption. These time-scales show significant deviations from the evolution expected for gas stripping mechanisms and suggest that either ram pressure stripping is much more efficient at high redshift, or that secular outflows quench satellites before orbit-based stripping occurs. Given the strong redshift evolution of star formation rates, at high redshift even moderate outflow rates will lead to extremely short delay times with the expectation that high-redshift (z > 1.5) satellites will be quenched almost immediately following the cessation of cosmological inflow. Observations of high-redshift satellites give an indirect but sensitive measure of the outflow rate, with current measurements suggesting that outflows are no larger than 2.5 times the star formation rate for galaxies with a stellar mass of 1010.5M⊙. © 2014 The Authors.

We compute a "conversion fraction" f convert that represents the fraction of galaxies that were prematurely quenched by their environment. For massive galaxies, M star ą 10 10.3 M d , we find f convert " 0.4 in the groups and " 0.6 in the clusters, similar to comparable measurements at z " 0. This means the time between first accretion into a more massive halo and final star formation quenching is t p " 2 Gyr. This is substantially longer than the estimated time required for a galaxy's star formation rate to become zero once it starts to decline, suggesting there is a long delay time during which little differential evolution occurs. In contrast with local observations we find evidence that this delay timescale may depend on stellar mass, with t p approaching t Hubble for M star " 10 9.5 M d. The result suggests that the delay time must not only be much shorter than it is today, but may also depend on stellar mass in a way that is not consistent with a simple evolution in proportion to the dynamical time. Instead, we find the data are well-matched by a model in which the decline in star formation is due to "overconsumption", the exhaustion of a gas reservoir through star formation and expulsion via modest outflows in the absence of cosmological accretion. Dynamical gas removal processes, which are likely dominant in quenching newly accreted satellites today, may play only a secondary role at z " 1.},

   abstract = {We have carried out two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamical simulations in order to study the interaction between supernova-powered gas outflows from low-mass galaxies and the local intergalactic medium (IGM). We are specifically interested in investigating whether a high-pressure IGM, such as that in clusters of galaxies, can prevent the gas from escaping from the galaxy, as suggested by Babul & Rees. We find that this is indeed the case as long as ram pressure effects are negligible. The interface between the outflow and the ambient IGM is demarcated by a dense expanding shell formed by the gas swept up by the outflow. A sufficiently high IGM pressure can bring the shell to a halt well before it escapes the galaxy. Galaxies in such high-pressure environments are, however, more likely than not to be ploughing through the IGM at relatively high velocities. Hence, they will also be subject to ram pressure, which acts to strip the gas from the galaxy. We have carried out simulations that take into account the combined impact of ram pressure and thermal pressure. We find that ram pressure deforms the shell into a tail-like structure, fragments it into dense clouds and eventually drags the clouds away from the galaxy. The clouds are potential sites of star formation and if viewed during this transient phase, the galaxy will appear to have a low-surface-brightness tail much like the galaxies with diffuse comet-like tails seen in the z  1X15 cluster 3C324. The stars in the tail would, in time, stream away from the galaxy and become part of the intracluster environment. In contrast, the relatively unhindered outflows in low-density, low-temperature environments can drive the shells of swept-up gas out to large distances from the galaxy. Such shells, if they intersect a quasar line of sight, would give rise to Lya absorption lines of the kind seen in quasar spectra. In addition, the fact that outflows from low-mass galaxies can extend out to distances of 40 kpc or more indicates that such galaxies may have played an important role in polluting the intergalactic medium with metals.},

A residual band of gapless quasiparticles whose spin and charge coherence factors vanish linearly in energy, decouples from the condensate. The unusual energy dependence of these coherence factors leads to a T3 NMR relaxation rate at a conduction electron site that coexists with a linear specific heat. Two verifiable predictions of the theory are (i) that a Korringa relaxation will fail to develop in heavy-fermion superconductors, even in the limit of strong pair breaking and severe gaplessness and (ii) that the hitherto unmeasured NMR relaxation rate at the actinide or rare-earth site will become exponentially activated in the superconducting phase. © 1994 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {Current theories of superfluidity are based on the idea of a coherent quantum state with topologically protected quantized circulation. When this topological protection is absent, as in the case of He3-A, the coherent quantum state no longer supports persistent superflow. Here, we argue that the loss of topological protection in a superconductor gives rise to an insulating ground state. We specifically introduce the concept of a Skyrme insulator to describe the coherent dielectric state that results from the topological failure of superflow carried by a complex-vector order parameter. We apply this idea to the case of SmB6, arguing that the observation of a diamagnetic Fermi surface within an insulating bulk can be understood as a realization of this state. Our theory enables us to understand the linear specific heat of SmB6 in terms of a neutral Majorana Fermi sea and leads us to predict that in low fields of order a Gauss, SmB6 will develop a Meissner effect.},

   abstract = {In an exciting development, SmB6 , a Kondo insulator has been shown to exhibit bulk quantum oscillations. We propose that SmB6 is a bulk scalar Majorana Fermi Liquid (MFL) with a finite gap for charge and spin excitations. In a theoretical study of Kondo insulators in 1993, Coleman, Miranda and Tsvelik (CMT) envisaged such a remarkable possibility, using a mean field ansatz. We generalize CMT theory to non-zero magnetic fields and show an unexpected result that a scalar Majorana fermi liquid, while remaining electrically insulating, responds to external magnetic field and exhibits quantum oscillations. Physics of an emergent compactified 2-channel Kondo lattice physics that is behind formation of the novel scalar Majorana fermi liquid phase is discussed. It is also suggested that a well known resistivity saturation at low temperatures in SmB6 may have an origin in the coherently fluctuating charge character of the soft scalar Majorana fermions. Possible presence of 2-dimensional Majorana fermion excitations in surfaces of SmB6, and other Topological Kondo Insulators (TKI) is pointed out. PACS numbers: Correlated electron systems continue to surprise us and spring forth unexpected phenomena. In this context , conceptually and physically simple experiments often reveal hidden truths about nature. Historically, low temperature specific heat measurements revealed to us the quantum secret of lattice vibrations. Same specific heat revealed fermi seas embedded in simple metals. In the same way magneto torque measurements, as dHvA quantum oscillations [1], revealed to us shapes of fermi surfaces in k-space. They have been invaluable in understanding heavy fermions, Kondo insulators [2, 3], high Tc cuprates and so on. A recent experimental observation [4] of quantum oscillations in SmB 6 , a Kondo insulator [5], in magneto torque measurements has come as a surprise and challenge. Quantum oscillations are known to occur in metals that support charged quasi particles and fermi surfaces. SmB 6 is an insulator, albeit with a small charge gap. This oscillation is seen at low temperatures, where resis-tivity is high indicating an electrically insulating ground state. Meanfree paths of quasi particles that are causing quantum oscillations, as inferred from experiments, are anomalously large ∼ few microns. As an explanation for the observed quantum oscillations , we propose that SmB 6 supports a neutral scalar bulk Majorana fermi liquid with a fermi surface, making use of an early theory of Coleman, Miranda and Tsvelik [6]. If proved correct this will be a first clean example of a bulk Majorana fermi sea in a condensed matter system. A Majorana fermi sea [6, 9] has a zero energy (fermi) surface in k-space. However it has only particle like positive energy excitations, which are complex canonical fermions. Hole like excitations or antiparticles are simply absent. Such a one component free Majorana fermi sea can not be obtained by filling single particle states below a chemical potential. Currently popular Majorana zero energy mode [10] (in the context of topological quantum computation) is a scalar fermion; pair of such zero modes forms a complex canonical fermion. Our proposal becomes interesting in the background of an intense search for localized Majorana zero modes at, vortex cores, chain ends, surfaces, heterostructures [11]. There has been search for Majorana Fermi sea [12] in Ki-taev models and real systems (Kitaev-Khaliulin-Jackeli materials) [13] etc. Isolating Majorana fermions or inducing zero Majorana modes for manipulation for topologi-cal quantum computation should be feasible at surfaces of SmB 6 and suitably engineered heterostructures. Being a Topological Kondo Insulator [18], SmB 6 is likely to have Majorana modes on its surfaces, edges and defects. Qantum oscillations in a metal arises from magnetic field induced Landau quantization of one electron states. Kondo insulator, with a finite charge gap (>> ω c), is not expected to behave like a normal fermi liquid, in magneto torque measurements. Fermi surfaces seen in SmB 6 strongly resemble those of isostructural and iso-valent metallic counterparts LaB 6 and CeB 6. Temperature dependence of oscillation amplitudes are anomalous however and does not follow the Lifshitz Kosevich fro-mula. We call SmB 6 as longitudinal insulator and transverse metal. Another important known experimental result [14] is presence of a small spin gap, in addition to charge gap. Optics in this material is also interesting and strongly temperature dependent [15]. Using the above we make two straight forward inferences: i) presence of low energy zero spin quasi particles that are charge neutral and ii) presence of fermi surfaces, some what similar to spinful fermi liquid counterparts LaB 6 and CeB 6. We envisage three possibilities. First one is that SmB 6 is a quantum spin liquid state that has a spinon pseudo fermi surface. Spin gap excludes this possibility. Second possibility is presence of a gapless spin singlet excitations with a pseudo fermi surface and a gap for spin-1 excitations; this is suspected to be present in},

A number of recent experiments have suggested the possibility that the low-Temperature insulating bulk hosts electrically neutral gapless fermionic excitations. Here we show that a possible ground state of strongly correlated mixed valence insulators-a composite exciton Fermi liquid-hosts a three dimensional Fermi surface of a neutral fermion, that we name the "composite exciton." We describe the mechanism responsible for the formation of such excitons, discuss the phenomenology of the composite exciton Fermi liquids and make comparison to experiments in SmB6.},
